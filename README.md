# 101 Practice SQL Questions

This repository contains my solutions to the "101 Practice SQL Questions" course on Udemy. Each question has a corresponding SQL script file that provides the solution.

## Course Description

The "101 Practice SQL Questions" course on Udemy is designed to help you improve your SQL skills through practice. It covers a wide range of SQL concepts and scenarios, providing you with hands-on exercises to strengthen your understanding of SQL queries, data manipulation, and database management.

## Using the AdventureWorks Sample Database

Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) will be the database management system used in the course. All the questions in the course are answered using the Microsoft Sample database, AdventureWorks. The AdventureWorks database is a comprehensive and widely-used sample database that simulates a fictional bike manufacturing company.

Before using the SQL script files in this repository, ensure that you have set up the AdventureWorks sample database. You can download and install the AdventureWorks database from the official Microsoft GitHub repository: [AdventureWorks Database](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/adventure-works)

Follow the installation instructions provided in the repository to set up the AdventureWorks database on your local SQL Server instance. Once the database is set up, you can proceed with executing the SQL script files in this repository against the AdventureWorks database.
